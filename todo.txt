X Fix the name not udpating issue
Update the name to reflect the new name even if the simulation is reset and the planet is clicked in GUI
Adding/Removing new planets should happen instantaneously
    Should this restart the simulation or just continue it?
    Continuing it would involve adding it dynamically to the particle system
        Pause the simulation
        The parameters would need to be synced 

X Managing Live Editing and Simulation Starting Point
    Live editing
        Planets would be moved around and velocities changed by the mouse
        "Lock" button "Use this as the starting point"
        If planets are added during this mode, they will removed on reset unless the values are saved as starting point
        If a planet is added and reset simulation button is hit, all the current values will be used, which 
        includes the list of new planets
        If values are changed in the dialog boxes, should they be changed in the planets directly as well? 
        Only if sim is paused. 

What happens if a bunch of planets start at the same point and some sort of
    accumulation code is written that accumulates planets that come too close
X Style the UI - Used flexbox CSS to make the UI pretty
Add velocity selection through mouse right click
X Fix adding a planet doesn't automatically select it
Add tooltip to buttons
Add gravitation constant and simulation speed parameters
