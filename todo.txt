X Fix the name not udpating issue
X Managing Live Editing and Simulation Starting Point
    Live editing
        Planets would be moved around and velocities changed by the mouse
        "Lock" button "Use this as the starting point"
        If planets are added during this mode, they will removed on reset unless the values are saved as starting point
        If a planet is added and reset simulation button is hit, all the current values will be used, which 
        includes the list of new planets
        If values are changed in the dialog boxes, should they be changed in the planets directly as well? 
        Only if sim is paused. 

X Fix adding a planet doesn't automatically select it
X Style the UI - Used flexbox CSS to make the UI pretty
X Add velocity selection through mouse right click
X Add gravitation constant and simulation speed parameters
At higher simulation speeds, the simulation becomes unstable and keeps adding an error in every revolution
    We need RK-3 because acceleration is also changing with time and therefore needs to be accounted for
Update the name to reflect the new name even if the simulation is reset and the planet is clicked in GUI
What happens if a bunch of planets start at the same point and some sort of
    accumulation code is written that accumulates planets that come too close
Add tooltip to buttons
Add a way to save/load the current configuration in a downloadable file
