X Fix the name not udpating issue
X Managing Live Editing and Simulation Starting Point
    Live editing
        Planets would be moved around and velocities changed by the mouse
        "Lock" button "Use this as the starting point"
        If planets are added during this mode, they will removed on reset unless the values are saved as starting point
        If a planet is added and reset simulation button is hit, all the current values will be used, which 
        includes the list of new planets
        If values are changed in the dialog boxes, should they be changed in the planets directly as well? 
        Only if sim is paused. 

X Fix adding a planet doesn't automatically select it
X Style the UI - Used flexbox CSS to make the UI pretty
X Add velocity selection through mouse right click
X Add gravitation constant and simulation speed parameters
X At higher simulation speeds, the simulation becomes unstable and keeps adding an error in every revolution
X    We need RK-4 because acceleration is also changing with time and therefore needs to be accounted for
X Fix the remove planet bug - When a planet is removed, it isnt removed immediately from the simulation. If the simulation
X    is reset at this point
X Add zoom to be able to better see the moons orbit
X Add a hot streak behind planets to show their orbits
X Add some sprinkled stars
X Create labels on planets
X    Perma labels that display the names or
    Labels that only show up when a planet is hovered (touch devices?)
Zoom to the planets when one is clicked, following it, facing the sun
Add elliptical orbits even if the planets dont follow them
Year selection
X    Add the ability to select a date to go to from the current date
X        Would need to be able to say what date it is from the position of the earths orbit 
    Add a news ticker that displays some news events from the year that the planet is in
Update the name to reflect the new name even if the simulation is reset and the planet is clicked in GUI
What happens if a bunch of planets start at the same point and some sort of
    accumulation code is written that accumulates planets that come too close
Add tooltip to buttons
Add a way to save/load the current configuration in a downloadable file
